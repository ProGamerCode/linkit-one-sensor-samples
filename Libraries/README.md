# Installing the libraries

The libraries in this portion of the repo will help you work with various sensors and displays for the LinkIt ONE. Follow [this guide](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries) to learn how to install and use libraries in the Arduino IDE.

On Windows, these libraries should be placed in `My Documents\Arduino\libraries`. On the Mac they should be placed in `Documents/Arduino/libraries/`.

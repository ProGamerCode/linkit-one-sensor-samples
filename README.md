# Samples for the LinkIt ONE Starter Kit
These samples should help you get started using the various sensors that are available in the [LinkIt ONE Starter Kit](http://www.amazon.com/Seeedstudio-Grove-Starter-LinkIt-ONE-Open-Source-Maker/dp/B01AND8SCK/ref=sr_1_1). If you received a hackpack at [SIGNAL](https://twilio.com/signal) you can use these samples to test out additional sensors. The sensors in these demos are available in the [Grove Starter Kit for LinkIt ONE](http://www.amazon.com/Seeedstudio-Grove-Starter-LinkIt-ONE-Open-Source-Maker/dp/B01AND8SCK/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1464043814&sr=8-3&keywords=grove+sensor+kit).

## Setup
If you need to get your LinkIt ONE set up and ready to use in the Arduino IDE you can follow the steps in [this blog post](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2016/05/getting-started-with-arduino-on-the-linkit-one.html). Once you have that working you are ready to try the Sketches found in this repository.

## How to Run the Samples
After cloning the repository, open any of the Sketch (`.ino`) files in the Arduino IDE and upload them to your LinkIt ONE. Make sure to have the sensor(s) used in the sample plugged into the proper port on the LinkIt ONE base shield or onboard port.

## What's Next
Now that you know how to use more sensors with your LinkIt ONE, there are many more projects you can build. Try some of these out:

* Build an alarm system
* Build a humidity and temperature monitor
* Build a noise monitor to track noisy neighbors
